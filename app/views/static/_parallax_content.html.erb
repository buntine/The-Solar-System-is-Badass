<p>Parallax is an apparent displacement or difference in the apparent position of an object viewed along two different lines of sight, and is measured by the angle or semi-angle of inclination between those two lines. The term is derived from the <a href="#">Greek</a> παράλλαξις (parallaxis), meaning "alteration". Nearby objects have a larger parallax than more distant objects when observed from different positions, so parallax can be used to determine distances.</p>
<p>Astronomers use the principle of parallax to measure distances to celestial objects including to the <a href="#">Moon</a>, the <a href="#">Sun</a>, and to stars beyond the Solar System. For example, the Hipparcos satellite took measurements for over 100,000 nearby stars. This provides a basis for other distance measurements in astronomy, the cosmic distance ladder. Here, the term "parallax" is the angle or semi-angle of inclination between two sight-lines to the star.</p>

<p>Parallax also affects optical instruments such as <a href="#">binoculars</a>, <a href="#">microscopes</a>, and twin-lens reflex cameras that view objects from slightly different angles. Many animals, including humans, have two eyes with overlapping visual fields that use parallax to gain depth perception; this process is known as stereopsis. In computer vision the effect is used for computer stereo vision, and there is a device called a parallax rangefinder that uses it to find range, and in some variations also altitude to a target.</p>
<p>A simple everyday example of parallax can be seen in the dashboard of motor vehicles that use an older-style "needle" speedometer gauge. When viewed from directly in front, the speed may show exactly 60; but when viewed from the passenger seat the needle may appear to show a slightly different <a href="#">speed</a>, due to the angle of viewing.</p>
<h2>Visual perception</h2>
<p>As the eyes of humans and other animals are in different positions on the head, they present different views simultaneously. This is the basis of <a href="#">stereopsis</a>, the process by which the brain exploits the parallax due to the different views from the eye to gain depth perception and estimate distances to objects.[3] Animals also use motion parallax, in which the animals (or just the head) move to gain different viewpoints. For example, <a href="#">pigeons</a> (whose eyes do not have overlapping fields of view and thus cannot use stereopsis) bob their heads up and down to see depth.</p>

<p>The universe is commonly defined as the totality of everything that exists, including all <a href="#">space</a>, <a href="#">time</a>, <a href="#">matter</a>, <a href="#">energy</a>, <a href="#">planets</a>, <a href="#">stars</a>, <a href="#">galaxies</a>, <a href="#">intergalactic space</a>, and beyond. Definitions and usage vary and similar terms include the cosmos, the world and nature. Scientific observation of earlier stages in the development of the universe, which can be seen at great distances, suggests that the universe has been governed by the same physical laws and constants throughout most of its extent and history. There are various <a href="#">multiverse</a> theories, in which physicists have suggested the universe is one among many universes that likewise exist.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Throughout recorded history, several cosmologies and cosmogonies have been proposed to account for observations of the universe. The earliest quantitative geocentric models were developed by the ancient <a href="#">Greeks</a>. Over the centuries, more precise observations and improved theories of gravity led to Copernicus's <a href="#">heliocentric model</a> and the <a href="#">Newtonian</a> model of the Solar System, respectively.</p>
<p>Further improvements in astronomy led to the realization that the Solar System is embedded in a galaxy composed of billions of stars, the <a href="#">Milky Way</a>, and that other galaxies exist outside it, as far as astronomical instruments can reach. Careful studies of the distribution of these galaxies and their spectral lines have led to much of modern cosmology. Discovery of the red shift and cosmic microwave background radiation revealed that the universe is expanding and apparently had a beginning.</p>

<h2>Theoretical models</h2>
<p>Of the four fundamental interactions, gravitation is dominant at cosmological length scales; that is, the other three forces are believed to play a negligible role in determining structures at the level of <a href="#">planets</a>, <a href="#">stars</a>, <a href="#">galaxies</a> and larger-scale structures. Since all matter and energy gravitate, gravity's effects are cumulative; by contrast, the effects of positive and negative charges tend to cancel one another, making electromagnetism relatively insignificant on cosmological length scales. The remaining two interactions, the weak and strong <a href="#">nuclear forces</a>, decline very rapidly with distance; their effects are confined mainly to sub-atomic length scales.</p>

<h2>The Big Bang</h2>
<p>The prevailing Big Bang model accounts for many of the experimental observations described above, such as the correlation of distance and <a href="#">redshift</a> of galaxies, the universal ratio of hydrogen:helium atoms, and the ubiquitous, isotropic microwave radiation background. As noted above, the redshift arises from the metric expansion of space; as the space itself expands, the wavelength of a <a href="#">photon</a> traveling through space likewise increases, decreasing its energy. The longer a photon has been traveling, the more expansion it has undergone; hence, older photons from more distant galaxies are the most red-shifted. Determining the correlation between distance and redshift is an important problem in experimental physical cosmology.</p>

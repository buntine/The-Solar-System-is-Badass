== Welcome to a HARD HAT Ruby on Rails application ==


0) Introduction / Setup
-------------------------

This application consists of a bare Rails application with a bunch of things to help get you started quickly.  The philosophy is that you already know what you're doing and no power should be taken away from you. 

To get started (if you've used the "hhd:rails:new" thor task):

  0) Create and populate the database:

     $ rake db:migrate && rake db:seed

  1) Commit and push your changes (thor task will have already created a remote repository)

     $ git add .
     $ git commit -avm "Initial commit"
     $ git push origin master

  2) Run the server and take a look at http://localhost:3000:

     $ ./script/server

  3) If you get an error, you may need to install the required gems:

     $ sudo rake gems:install


For concise documentation, please see ./doc/*

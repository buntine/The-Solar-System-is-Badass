Tiny-mce-upload
===============

This plugin will let you add a button to tiny mce for uploading and inserting
an image directly into the content. It uses a rails model to keep track of the
images. If you want to set a max size it should be done in the model using file
column. The user will be able to further resize their image using html in Tiny
MCE. There is an admin area for maintaining uploaded images, allowing you to
remove orphaned pictures.

Shit to say

- What is Parallax?
  - Parallax is the apparent displacement of an object when viewed from multiple viewpoints.
  - For example:
    - Open one eye and focus on something far away
    - Then toggle each eye, you should notice the displacement if you keep doing this.
    - Now place a finger about 30cm in front of you.
    - Repeat the second step
    - The parallax of your finger will be much greater than that of the original object that is further away.
  - Humans perceive depth because our two eyes cross our vision.
  - Some animals (like pigeons) have eyes too far back in their skull, so they bob their head to perceive depth.
  - Can be used to calculate distances of things that are very far away, such as planets and stars.

- History on the web?
  - Nike started this trend with NikeBetterWorld.com, which is still available online.
  - Many companies have followed, the technique is now well understood.

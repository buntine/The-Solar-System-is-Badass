Shit to say

- Andrew Buntine, call me bunts.
  - Lead developer at Hard Hat Digital.
  - 10 years experience, mostly web, but interested in programming languages, functional programming.
  - I'm going to discuss implementing parallax into your websites.

- What is Parallax?
  - Parallax is the apparent displacement of an object when viewed from multiple viewpoints.
  - For example:
    - Open one eye and focus on something far away
    - Then toggle each eye, you should notice the displacement if you keep doing this.
    - Now place a finger about 30cm in front of you.
    - Repeat the second step
    - The parallax of your finger will be much greater than that of the original object that is further away.
  - Humans perceive depth because our two eyes cross our vision.
  - Some animals (like pigeons) have eyes too far back in their skull, so they bob their head to perceive depth.
  - Can be used to calculate distances of things that are very far away, such as planets and stars.

- History on the web?
  - Nike started this trend with NikeBetterWorld.com, which is still available online.
  - Many companies have followed, the technique is now well understood.

- My example
  - No excuses for the design
  - Small Rails app
  - Scroll up and down
  - Demonstrate nav auto-scrolling

- My code
  - Works by overlaying divs on the page and positioning background images on them at fixed offsets.
  - Upon scrolling the window, we calculate new positions for the background images.
    - Images that are "closer" to the viewpoint should move at greater speeds.
  - The maths is simple:
    - h is the document height, p is the current offset, a is the adjuster value and i is the inertia.
    - a is the offset that will be apparent as the object moves out of sight.
      - browsers/monitors move at different intervals and so you should just tinker with it.
      - I use HTML5 data attributes.
    - i is the inertia of the object (or resistance to change) and should be between 0 (stationary) and 1 (same as scroll).
  - Packaged into a jQuery plugin
    - 14 lines of code!

- Drawbacks / Warnings
  - Yes, I've used this in production for McDonalds.
  - It's a bit of a fad, get onto the bandwagon SOON.
  - Ensure the designer understands that the display will be highly dynamic.
    - Think about how the site will look as the user is scrolling (images covering text, etc)

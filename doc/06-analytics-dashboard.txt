06. Google Analytics dashboard
------------------

Implementation
----------------

The template ships with pre-installed support for integrating Google analytics information into the landing page of the CMS.

By default, the analytics dashboard will not display because the template does not know which analytics account and profile to request information for.

To enable the dashboard, simply provide a analytics username, password and profile ID in the AppConfig file (./config/app_cnofig.rb).

That's it! The dashboard should appear on login to the CMS.
